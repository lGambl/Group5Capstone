StudyHall

The purpose of this project is to create an app for collating of sources and note taking attached to those sources with the intent of returning to these sources and notes at a later date for studying.

Before running the project make sure to check that the db is up to date by opening the package manager console and typing
update-database

If it says that you are up to date then you are good to go. If any issues happen due to a database issue, attempt to run the update again but before running it got to aspEFMigrationsHistory table and delete the last entry.
